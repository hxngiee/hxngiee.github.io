# Beautiful Jekyll

**Beautiful Jekyll** is a ready-to-use template to help you create an awesome website quickly. Perfect for personal blogs or simple project websites.  [Check out a demo](http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll) of what you'll get after just two minutes.  You can also look at [my personal website](http://deanattali.com) to see it in use, or see examples of websites other people created using thcois theme [here](#featured-users-success-stories).

- [Build your website in 3 steps](#build-your-website-in-3-steps)

## Prerequisites
- You need to have a GitHub account. If you don't have one, [sign up here](https://github.com/join) - it takes one minute. This is where your website will live - if you sign up with username `johnsmith` then your website will be `http://johnsmith.github.io`.

### Very advanced: Local development
Beautiful Jekyll is meant to be so simple to use that you can do it all within the browser. However, if you'd like to develop locally on your own machine, that's possible too if you're comfortable with command line. Follow these simple steps to do that with Vagrant:

1. Install [VirtualBox](http://virtualbox.org) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com)
2. Clone your fork `git clone git@github.com:yourusername/yourusername.github.io.git`
3. Inside your repository folder, run `vagrant up`

Disclaimer: I personally am NOT using local development so I don't know much about running Jekyll locally. If you follow this route, please don't ask me questions because unfortunately I honestly won't be able to help!

### Credits
This template was not made entirely from scratch. I would like to give special thanks to:
- [Barry Clark](https://github.com/barryclark) and his project [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), from whom I've taken several ideas and code snippets, as well as some documenation tips.

### Contributions
Thank you to [all contributors](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll/graphs/contributors). Special thanks to the following people with non-trivial contributions (in chronological order): [@hristoyankov](https://github.com/hristoyankov), [@jamesonzimmer](https://github.com/jamesonzimmer), [@XNerv](https://github.com/XNerv), [@epwalsh](https://github.com/epwalsh), [@rtlee9](https://github.com/rtlee9).
If you do fork or clone this project to use as a template for your site, I would appreciate if you keep the link in the footer to this project.  I've noticed that several people who forked this repo removed the attribution and I would prefer to get the recognition if you do use this :)

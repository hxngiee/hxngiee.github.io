### 🙋‍♂️ Introduction
- Hello! I am an AI Research Engineer working at Narnialabs with Prof. Namwoo Kang. Before joining the company, I was a research member at CVLAB with Prof. Seungryong Kim and VIVE STUDIOS. My research focuses on Generative AI that can produce various types of content (Image / Video / 3D) and its applications. Recently, my research focus has been intensely drawn to the manufacturing generative AI especially in generating Computer-Aided Designs (CAD) and automated sequence planning for assembly.
